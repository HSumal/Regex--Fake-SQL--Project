Base/Starter Files are in the "Starter 2"

Functions that I created are within "Starter" in the squeal.py and reading.py files

Created several functions to act as Regex (Regular Expressions) as well as functions to read tables.

In reading.py created;
  - read_table
  - read_database
  
In squeal.py created;
  - run_query
  - select_table
  - where_table
  - cartesian_product
